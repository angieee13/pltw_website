       My name is Angelica Caudillo but I'd rather be called Angie.I am 14 years old and love pizza. I also came from Washington Middle School. I love to go out and hang out with my friends and family. I enjoy plsying volleyball because it's a raelly fun sport to play and it get you get really active. I also enjoy playing soccer because you get to work as a team and work together to get the ball in to the goal.I like to listen to english and spanish music. My cousins and I are really close that's what I like about my family. I enjoy going to Tijuanna, Mexico because I get to see my dad and spend time with him since we don't see each other that often. The beaches there are really pretty and enjoyable. When I go to Mexico I love going to eat tacos there they are so delicous.I have one sister and one brother   <p>
